    <ol class="li">
        <li>Css stands for Cascading Style Sheets.</li><br><br>
        <li>Css describe how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen,paper,or in other media.</li><br><br>
        <li><span class="line3">Css is not necessary</span><span style="background-color: yellow;"> CSS saves alot of work.</span>It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once</li><br><br>
        <li><span class="line4">External stylesheets are stored in CSS files.</span></li><br><br>
    </ol>
    <h1 class="heading2">CSS can be added to HTML documents in 3 ways:</h1>
    <ul type="square" class="li1">
        <li >Inline - by using the style attribute inside HTML elements1</li>
        <li>Internal  -by using a style elements in the head section</li>
        <li>External -by using a link elements to link to an external CSS files</li>
        <li>The most common way to add CSS is to keep the styles in external CSS files.However, <span class="sp">in thistutorial we will use inline and internal styles,</span> becuse this is easier to demonstrate, and easier for youbto try to try it yourself.</li>
        
    </ul>
    <p>When compatring CSS class vs ID the difference is that CSS class applies to multiple elements.ID, on the other hand,applies a style to one elements ID is also special in that you can use aspecial URL to link directly to an element and it's used by JavaScript.</p>
    <p>In CSS ,selectors are used to target a specific element or range of elements on a web page. Once an element has been targeted, astyle or set of styles can be applied to the element.</p>
    <p>There is a wide range of selectors available. Two of the most commonly used are class and ID. Both are used to target elements to which a style should be applied.</p>
